Project: Bookify Hotel Reservation System with ASP.NET Core 
Objective: To build a robust and scalable hotel reservation web application, leveraging design 
patterns like N-Tier Architecture, the Repository Pattern, and Unit of Work for a clean, 
maintainable, and professional codebase. 
Description: Bookify is a comprehensive hotel booking platform that allows customers to search 
for available rooms, view room details, and make reservations using an integrated payment 
system. The application will also feature a powerful admin panel for hotel staff to manage room 
types, individual rooms, and all customer bookings. The entire system will be built following the 
N-Tier architecture to ensure a clear separation between the UI, business logic, and data access 
layers. 
Design Patterns to Use: 
• N-Tier Architecture: Structuring the application into a Presentation Layer (UI), a 
Business Logic Layer (Services), and a Data Access Layer. 
• Repository Pattern: Abstracting all database operations to provide a clean and 
consistent API for data access. 
• Unit of Work Pattern: Ensuring that complex operations, like creating a booking and 
updating room availability, are completed in a single, atomic transaction to maintain data 
integrity. 
• Dependency Injection: Loosely coupling the application's components by injecting 
services (like repositories) into controllers. 
Technologies to Use: ASP.NET Core MVC, Entity Framework Core, ASP.NET Identity, Stripe, 
JQuery, DataTables, Toaster JS. 
Week 1: Architecture Setup and Room Listings 
• N-Tier Architecture Setup: 
o Presentation Layer (Bookify.Web): The main ASP.NET Core MVC project 
containing controllers, views, and client-side assets (JQuery, etc.). 
o Business Logic Layer (Bookify.Services): A class library to handle business 
rules, such as checking room availability and calculating reservation costs. 
o Data Access Layer (Bookify.Data): A class library for implementing the 
Repository and Unit of Work patterns to communicate with the database. 
• Database Design: 
o Use Entity Framework Core to define the database schema for tables like 
Rooms, RoomTypes, Bookings, and Users. 
• Repository and Unit of Work Implementation: 
o Create generic and specific repositories (e.g., RoomRepository, 
BookingRepository) to abstract CRUD operations. The DbContext will function 
as the Unit of Work. 
• User Authentication Setup: 
o Configure ASP.NET Identity to manage user registration, login, and roles (e.g., 
Customer, Admin). 
Deliverables: 
• A solution with the complete N-Tier Architecture set up. 
• A public-facing page that lists available rooms, fetching data through the repository 
pattern. 
• Database schema created with Entity Framework Core Migrations. 
• A working user registration and login system. 
Week 2: Reservation Flow, Roles, and Admin Panel 
• Reservation Cart Functionality: 
o Implement a "reservation cart" using Session State where users can temporarily 
hold a room selection before confirming their booking. 
• Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): 
o Use ASP.NET Identity roles to secure the admin panel, ensuring only users with 
the "Admin" role can access it. 
• Admin Dashboard: 
o Create an admin interface for managing rooms, room types, and viewing all 
bookings. Utilize DataTables to display the information in a user-friendly way. 
All data operations must go through the Repository Pattern. 
Deliverables: 
• A fully functional reservation flow where users can select a room and dates. 
• Secure role-based permissions for admin and customer users. 
• An admin dashboard for managing the hotel's rooms and bookings. 
Week 3: Booking Confirmation and Stripe Integration 
• Booking Confirmation: 
o Implement the final checkout and booking confirmation logic. The process of 
creating a Booking record and updating the room's availability must be wrapped 
in a single transaction using the Unit of Work pattern. 
• Stripe Payment Integration: 
o Integrate the Stripe payment gateway to handle payments during the booking 
confirmation step. Securely process payments and store transaction references. 
• User Profiles and Booking History: 
o Create a profile page where authenticated users can view their personal details 
and see a history of their past and upcoming bookings. 
Deliverables: 
• A complete booking confirmation process with integrated Stripe payments. 
• A customer profile page with a viewable booking history. 
• Thoroughly tested booking and payment functionality. 
Week 4: Health Checks, Logging, and Final Polish 
• Implement Health Checks & Logging: 
o Add ASP.NET Core Health Checks to create a health endpoint (e.g., /health) 
that verifies the application's ability to connect to the database. 
o Integrate a structured logging framework (like Serilog) to write detailed, 
structured logs for requests, errors, and other important application events. 
• UI Enhancements: 
o Use JQuery and Toaster JS for a more dynamic and interactive user experience 
(e.g., pop-up notifications). Refine the site's look and feel with Bootstrap and 
custom CSS. 
• Final Testing: 
o Conduct comprehensive end-to-end testing of the entire application to ensure all 
features are working as expected. 
Deliverables: 
• A polished and responsive UI for both the customer-facing site and the admin panel. 
• A functional /health endpoint for monitoring the application's status. 
• Structured logging implemented throughout the application for easier debugging. 
• A complete, well-tested, and fully documented application.
